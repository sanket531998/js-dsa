Objectives
1. What are the drawbacks of first 3 sorts 
2. We will learn 3 more sorts
    a. Merge sort 
    b. Quick sort 
    c. radix sort


the sorting algos we learned till now dont work fast for more than 20 items 
1. the family of algo we will learn now reduce the time complexity 
from O(n2) to O(n logn)

2. there is trade off between efficiency and simplicity 
3. the more efficient algo are much simpler and generally takes longer to understand 

MERGE SORT 
1. It is a combination of merging and sorting, acutally 3 things 
   splitting up, sorting and merging 
2. It exploits the fact that arrays with 0 or 1 items are always sorted 
3. Works by decomposing larger arrays into smaller arrrays of 1 or 0 items 


Merging sorted arrays
