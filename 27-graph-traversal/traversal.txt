Traversal means Visiting, Updating, Checking each vertex in a graph 

Graph traversal uses 
1. Peer to peer networking 
2. Web crawlers
3. Finding closest matches/recommendations 
4. Shortest path problems 
  a. Navigation 
  b. Solving mazes 
  c. AI (shortest path to win the game)


2] DEPTH FIRST SEARCH - depth first graph traversal 

  in this we priortise going deep in the graph first
  Its easier on a tree, because we have a direction and root to go to but in a graph 
  we can start from anywhere  
  there is no root node in graph for depth first search 

  we start at a number (0). then lets say we always choose the lowest number as 
  our next item to visit 
  DFS: 0 1 5 6 7 8 
  BFS: 0 1 2 6 5 3 4 

  DFS example 
  A B C D E F 
  We have to remember where we have been because we dont want to repeat the path and have 
  duplicate values 
  DFS in graph: Finding one neighbour and then go to its child before we go to the siblings 
  of the first node 
  Idea: We follow a branch down 

  BFS example 
  A B E C D F

there are 2 ways for DFS: 
a) Recursive and
b) Itterative 

DFS Recursive intro 
1. there is no start point 

BFS 
BFS prioritised visiting neighbours at current depth first 
we will use queue
