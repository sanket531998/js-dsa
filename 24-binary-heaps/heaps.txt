Heaps are another category of trees 
So everything that applies to trees applies to heaps as well but there are 
additional considerations and rules 

There are many types among heaps 

We are focusing on binary heaps and in that there are 2 types 
1. Min heaps 
2. Max heaps 

Objectives
1. Define a heap 
2. Compare min and max heaps 
3. Implement basic methods on heaps 
4. Where heaps are used in real world and what other DS can be constructed 
   from heaps 


1] What is a binary heap

    Heap is a tress structure, very similar to binary search tree, but with some 
    different rules
    In a MaxBinaryHeap, parent: larger than child nodes
    In a MinBinaryHeap, parent: smaller than child nodes 
    So just like the binary search tree, each node can have at most 2 children
    But unlike the binary search tree there is no order between left n right 

  a] Max Binary Heap 
     1. each parent has at most 2 child nodes
     2. the value of each parent node is always greater than its child node
     3. in a max binary heap the parent is greater than the children, but there are
        no guarantees between the siblings nodes 
     4. a binary heap is as compact as possible. all the children of each nodes are as 
        full as they can be and left children are filled out first 

Usage of binary heaps 
a. Prioroty queues - very commonly used DS
