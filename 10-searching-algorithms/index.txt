JS already has many methods which do searching 
1. indexOf
2. includes 
3. find
4. findIndex


Linear search: We visit one item at a time 
Big O of the linear search is O(n) because the time complexity grows linearly with the size of the input data.
Best: O(1)  ||  Worst: O(n)  ||  Average: O(n)

Binary Arrays 

  Binary arrays only work on sorted arrays 
  Binary search is divide and conquer 
  Binary search Time complexity 
  Worst and Average case: O(log n)
  Best case: O(1)


Native string search
