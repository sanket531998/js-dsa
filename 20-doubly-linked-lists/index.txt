Doubly linked lists 

In this we add a pointer to the previous and next node 
Almost identical to singly linked lists, except every node has another pointer, to the previous node 
in singly linked lists we only point to the following node here we also point to the previous node 

Comparison with singly linked lists 
more memory === more flexibility ; is it a tradeoff

node 
-value
-next
-previous 

doublyLinkedList 
-head 
-tail 
-length 


pop: we can go to the tail and get previous item and just remove it rather than starting from the first node
